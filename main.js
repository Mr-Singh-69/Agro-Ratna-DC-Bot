**Ploughing**: Our Ploughing Mechanism will plough the field when you tell it to. It consists of one Servo Motor and is connected with the Arduino Uno.

**Seed Sowing Mechanism**: It will sow seeds automatically when required in the field. It consists of a Servo Motor and a creative Bottle System idea invented by the team.

**Soil Moisture**: It will automatically give water to the field when required. The flow of water can be controlled. It consists of a Soil Moisture Sensor, Arduino Nano, and a Breadboard.

**Grass Cutter**: It will cut the grass of the field when required. It is controlled by a DC Motor and Arduino Nano.

**Stone Remover**: It will remove stones located on the particular land. It is controlled by a DC Motor.

**Future Possibilities**:
- Smart AI-powered robots that can fully operate and manage the farm.
- Systems that provide water to the soil when needed automatically.
- Robots that detect animals or birds in the fields and buzz a siren to scare them away.
- Robots that detect the nutrients present in the soil and suggest which crops can be grown (not in our robot yet, but we aim to add it).`);
